# Vox Engine

NOTE:
i started redoing this project between v0.0.5 and v0.0.6 to have better mass rendering optimizations.
v0.0.6 has been REDONE completely from scratch. v0.0.7 will also be redone from scratch using the stuff i learned making v0.0.6, but with vulkan so i can use modern graphics techniques


i messed up guys  
vulkan  
such a pain  
not doing that  
going back to openGL

0.0.7 will be openGL w/ openDB for voxel storage and bullet physics for collisions :) <--- might use rigid bodies ;) well see.

Gonna try to get this (0.0.7) out for end of March.

0.0.7 almost done. trying to sort out so e optimization stuff with parallelization of syncing the world and meshing the world. might also implement a version of a greedy mesher.
